# Desafio t√©cnico de backend da Softdesign

### Documentation

This application uses spring boot with:
- Spring Web
- Spring Data MongoDB
- Lombok
- JUnit 5
- OpenAPI 3.0

I tried to use SOLID principles and just a bit of CLEAN CODE, since the application is very small and avoiding over-engineering was mandatory.

I didn't implement the part of the program where some kind of metadata for automation of form generation is returned for the mobile consumer. I talked with the interviewer and told her that I would return the proper JSON data from the apis as I usually do in my applications. I hope this will be enough.

Also, in spite of using a NoSql database such as MongoDb, it's a good practice to add indexes to the collections to speed up the process of querying them. For the simplicity of the code, I skept such approach.

To avoid over-engineering, I didn't implement interfaces for the conversation between the service layer and the model layer.

I only implemented a small bunch of integration tests, since the application is very small and the tests are very simple. I didn't implement unit tests for the model layer, since it is very simple.

Ideally properties with sensitive data (such as passwords) should be stored in environment variables outside the source code, but I didn't implement this for the sake of simplicity.

I used the *SonarLint* plugin to help me with code quality.

You can find the api specs (Swagger style) at the /api-docs endpoint.

### Extra task one
For the extra task one (validate CPF), it seems that the validation service is not working properly. So, I configured a variable in the application.properties file to enable or disable the validation. The default value is false. To enable the validation, set the value to true.

### Extra task two
Regarding the extra task two (how to test performance of the application), an excellent choice for that is to use the JMeter application. With that application, we can create a test plan and configure how many threads we want to simulate to access the apis simoultaneously, how many calls in each thread, pauses between the calls and so on.

### Extra task three
Finally, answering the extra task three, the best approach to version RestFul apis is providing a /v<<n>> between the base url and name of the service. Ideally, versioning occurs when, somehow, the contract data is broken. When, for example, a api starts demanding a new mandatory field that it didn't before. Versioning is important to avoid breaking the clients that are already using the api. The versioning should be done in a way that the clients can choose to migrate to the new version when they are ready. 

### How to run the application
Having a docker and docker-compose installed, just run the following command in the root folder of the project (linux):

```
bash +x start.sh
bash ./install.sh
```

After running the command, all the apis will be available at http://localhost:8080
You also can find the PostmanCollection folder at the root folder with a postman collection to test the apis.
